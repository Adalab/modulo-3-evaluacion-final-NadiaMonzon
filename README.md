## Functionality of the page

Here is a website where you can search for the Harry Potter characters that you like the most.
You will find a text input where you will have to type the character's name you want to search for. Next to it we have the house filter button, which you can click on and the options to choose from will be displayed (all houses, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Unknown), although by default Gryffindor will be selected.
A list of them will appear there. You can select any character to be redirected to their own card and show you the available information about them (name, species, gender, whether it is alive or dead and, of course, the house it belongs to).
Once you go back with the "Get back to the list" button, you will see that the information you entered for filtering will remain in the inputs.
In case the character you are looking for does not appear, you will get a message that -x character-, that you should try to find another name or in another house.

## Technologies used

The project is made entirely with React.
We have used the character data provided by this [API](http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters)
